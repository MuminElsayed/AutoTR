# AutoTR
This is a auto transcriptor that I made during my work study period in the registrar, back when everything was done manually. This automatically copies data from the record file into the transcript.

I created a macro that automatically adds all the data from a studentâ€™s record into the transcript file. The user had only to add the initial parameter of how many semesters to copy, which is the number of sheets the macro goes through. Then it copies and pastes every cell automatically and inserts it into the designated cell in the transcript file.
